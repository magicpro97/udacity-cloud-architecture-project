Poor Security Practices:

1. Using HTTP instead of HTTPS for Load Balancer Communication:
   The load balancer is set to listen on port 80, which uses unencrypted HTTP. This practice exposes the web service to potential eavesdropping and interception of data. 
   Justification: HTTPS should be used to encrypt data in transit, especially for public-facing services, to protect sensitive information and ensure confidentiality.

2. Public Exposure of Web Application and Attack Simulation Instances:
   Both the web application and attack simulation instances are deployed with public IPs, making them directly accessible from the internet. This increases the risk of attacks.
   Justification: Instances should be placed behind private subnets, with only the load balancer exposed to the public. This reduces the attack surface and limits direct access to the instances.
